# Working-with-VPNs

This project demonstrates how Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) help protect user privacy and enable secure communication online. It involves hands-on steps using a Chrome-based VPN extension and highlights VPN functionality, encryption, and performance considerations.

## 📌 Objective

To explore how VPNs change IP addresses, encrypt traffic, affect browsing speed, and contribute to secure and private internet usage.

### 4. **Traffic Encryption Confirmation**
To confirm encrypted traffic:
- Visit any secure website (e.g., `https://example.com`).
- Click the lock icon in Chrome’s address bar.
- Click “Connection is secure” → then “Certificate” to view HTTPS encryption details.

### 6. **VPN Disconnected – Speed/IP Comparison**
- Disconnected from the VPN.
- Compared IP and browsing speed on the same website.
- Used the online website https://speedof.me/ to test the speed of local network and vpn.

### 7. **VPN Encryption & Privacy Features Research**
- VPNs use protocols like **OpenVPN**, **WireGuard**, and **IKEv2/IPSec**.
- Key privacy features:
  - IP masking
  - No-log policies (provider dependent)
  - DNS leak protection
  - Kill switches

---

### 8. **Summary of VPN Benefits & Limitations**

#### ✅ Benefits:
- Hides real IP address
- Encrypts internet traffic
- Secures public Wi-Fi usage
- Bypasses regional restrictions

#### ⚠️ Limitations:
- Free VPNs may collect logs or display ads
- Can slow down internet speed
- Not a full substitute for antivirus or secure browsing practices
- Trust in the provider is essential
